//STEP 1
// Write a function called halfNumber() that accepts one argument (a number), divide it by 2, and return the result. It should log a string like "Half of 5 is 2.5.".

function halfNumber(numbers) {
    let result = numbers / 2
    console.log(`Half of ${numbers} is ${result}`)
}
halfNumber()
halfNumber(6)
